Random Town
Team %d
"""There are no players on the map.""
You must have at least one hero, or town, belonging to a player or the map will be unplayable.
"
"""There are no towns on the map.""
This will not make a map unplayable.  However, a player’s last hero cannot exist without an affiliated town for more than seven days without losing.
"
"""The map is unnamed.""
If a map is unnamed, it will appear at the top of the list of available maps to play, titled Unnamed.
"
"""The map has no description.""
This is simply a warning.  Most maps describe the basis of the scenario and the player’s objective.
"
"""The grail has been placed on the map but there are no obelisks on the map.""
Assuming the grail has already been placed, obelisks should be placed on a map for a player to uncover the grail.
"
"""%s owns one or more objects on the map, yet is not present.""
A common example of this type of error is flagging a mine, creature dwelling, garrison, etc., for a player, yet the player does not own any existing towns or heroes.
"
"""The %s has a shipyard yet is landlocked.""
If a town with shipyard is landlocked, a player will be able to purchase boats, but the boats will not appear on the map.  A town must be adjacent to, but on top of, a shore tile to the left or right bottom corner of the town entrance.
"
"""There is only one %s two-way monolith on the map.""
‘Two-way’ monoliths are ‘teleporters’.  If you have only one two-way monolith on the map, there is no exit for the entering hero.
"
"""There are one or more %s one-way monolith entrances on the map but no %s monolith exits.""
This error message applies to ‘one-way’ monoliths.  If you have a one-way monolith entrance on the map, there must be at least one exit for the associated entrance.
"
"""There are one or more %s one-way monolith exits on the map but no %s monolith entrances.""
This error message applies to ‘one-way’ monoliths.  If you have a one-way monolith exit on the map, there must be at least one entrance for the associated exit.
"
"""There are one or more subterranean gates on the map yet this map has no underground layer.""
Typically, subterranean gates are used to travel to another underground map layer.  If there is no underground layer, a hero will approach a subterranean gate, only to be turned away.
"
"""There are more subterranean gates above ground than underground.""
At the start of a scenario, each subterranean gate is ‘paired up’ with its closest partner on the opposite layer.  If there are more gates above, than below, they cannot pair up.
"
"""There are more subterranean gates underground than above ground.""
At the start of a scenario, each subterranean gate is ‘paired up’ with its closest partner on the opposite layer.  If there are more gates below, than above, they cannot pair up.
"
"""The quest artifact of the %s is the %s, but the artifact has not been placed on the map.""
For a player to complete a Seer Hut quest, the object of the quest (the associated artifact), must exist on the map, with a hero, with a wandering monster, in an event, in a Pandora’s Box, or as a reward from another Seer’s Hut.
"
"""There is only one player on the map, yet there is no special victory condition.""
If there is only one player on the map, and there is no special victory condition, the single player would win the game instantly.
"
"""There is only one player on the map but the normal victory condition has not been disabled.""
If there is only one player on the map, and the normal victory condition has not been disabled, the single player would win the game instantly.
"
"""There are no problems with the map."""
"""The special victory condition is to acquire the %s, but this artifact has not been placed on the map.""
In order to satisfy the special victory condition ‘Acquire specific artifact’, the associated artifact must exist on the map, with a hero, with a wandering monster, in an event, in a Pandora’s Box, or as a reward from a Seer’s Hut.
"
"""The special victory condition is to acquire the %s, but %s already has this artifact.""
If a player’s hero starts a game with the artifact needed to satisfy the victory condition ‘Acquire specific artifact’, the player will instantly win the game.
"
"""The special victory condition is to acquire %d %s, but %s already has %d %s.""
If a player starts a game with the required number of a creature type needed to satisfy this victory condition, the player wins instantly.
"
"""The special victory condition is to build the %s and the %s in the %s, but both of these building are already built.""
At the start of the game, with the victory condition ‘Upgrade a specific town’, the player wins instantly if the player owns a town with a hall, and a castle, already pre-built to these levels.
"
"""The special victory condition is to build the %s and the %s in the %s, but one or both of these buildings are disabled.""
The player cannot win the game if the hall, or castle, is disabled.  This will prevent them from upgrading these buildings to the levels needed to win the game.
"
"""The special victory condition is to build the grail structure in the %s, but it is already built in this town.""
If the grail is pre-built in the specified town, the victory condition is satisfied immediately, and the player wins the game instantly.
"
"""The special victory condition is to build the grail structure in the %s, but it is disabled.""
If the grail is disabled in the specified town, the player will be unable to satisfy the victory condition ‘Build the Grail Structure’.  Thus, the player will be unable to win the game through this special victory condition.
"
"""The special victory condition is to build the grail structure, but there are no towns on the map in which it may be built.""
This error message appears when you select the ‘Build the Grail Structure’ special victory condition, but there are no towns on the map, or all the existing towns have the Grail Building disabled.
"
"""The special victory condition is to defeat %s who belongs to %s who may be a human player or be on a team with human players.""
If a human player, or team with a human player, already owns the specified hero at the start of the game, the victory condition ‘Defeat a specific hero’ is satisfied immediately, and the game is over.
"
"""The special victory condition is to capture the %s, but this town is already owned by %s.""
If a player, or team, already owns the specified town at the start of the game, the victory condition ‘Capture a specific town’ is satisfied immediately, and the game is over.
"
"""The special victory condition is to capture the %s, but this town is owned by %s who may be a human player or be on a team with human players.""
If a human player, or team with a human player, already owns the specified town at the start of the game, the victory condition ‘Capture a specific town’ is satisfied immediately, and the game is over.
"
"""The special victory condition is to flag all of the creature generators, but there are no creature generators on the map.""
"
"""The special victory condition is to flag all of the creature generators, but %s already owns all of the creature generators.""
"
"""The special victory condition is to flag all of the mines, but there are no mines on the map.""
"
"""The special victory condition is to flag all of the mines, but %s already owns all of the mines.""
"
"""The special victory condition is to transport the%s, but this artifact has not been placed on the map.""
For a player to transport the specified artifact, it must exist on the map, with a hero, with a wandering monster, in an event, in a Pandora’s Box, or as a reward from a Seer’s Hut.
"
"""The special loss condition is to lose the %s, but this town is not owned by any player.""
The special loss condition ‘Lose a specific town’ must be applied to the ‘one and only’ human player.  Otherwise, any human player not owning the town at the start of the game loses immediately.
"
"""The special loss condition is to lose the %s which is owned by %s, but this team cannot have any human players.""
The special loss condition ‘Lose a specific town’ must be applied to the ‘one and only’ team with human players.  Otherwise, any team, with human players, not owning the town at the start of the game, loses immediately.
"
"""The special loss condition is to lose the %s, but there is more than one team which may have human players.""
The special loss condition ‘Lose a specific town’ must be applied to the ‘one and only’ team with human players.  Otherwise, any team, with human players, not owning the town at the start of the game, loses immediately.
"
"""The special loss condition is to lose the %s which is owned by %s, but this player cannot be human.""
The special loss condition ‘Lose a specific town’ must be applied to the ‘one and only’ human player.  Otherwise, any human players not owning the town at the start of the game lose immediately.
"
"The special loss condition is to lose the %s, but there may be more than one human player.""
Any human who does not own the specified town at the start of the game will lose immediately.
"
"""The special loss condition is to lose %s, but this hero is not owned by any player.""
If the hero specified in the special loss condition ‘Lose a specific hero’, exists in a Prison, all players lose the game immediately.
"
"""The special loss condition is to lose %s who is owned by %s, but this team cannot have any human players.""
The team who owns the specified hero must have at least one human player.  Otherwise, any other existing teams with human players would immediately lose the game because they do not own the specified hero.
"
"""The special loss condition is to lose %s, but there is more than one team which may have human players.""
When the loss condition is to lose a specific hero, this hero must belong to the ‘one and only’ team, with human players, on the map.  If there are other teams with human players, and they don’t own the hero, they automatically lose the game.
"
"""The special loss condition is to lose %s who is owned by %s, but this player cannot be human.""

"""There are one or more %s keymaster's tents on this map but no %s border guards or border gates.""
The purpose of a keymaster's tent is to unlock its corresponding border guards and/or border gates.  If there are no corresponding border guards or border gates placed on the map, then the keymaster's tent is somewhat pointless.
"
"""There are one or more %s border guards on this map but no %s keymaster's tents.""
The purpose of the border guard is to block an area of the map until the player visits the corresponding keymaster's tent.  After visiting the keymaster's tent the border guard will disappear when visited.  However, if there is no corresponding keymaster's tent the border guard cannot be unlocked.
"
"""There are one or more %s border gates on this map but no %s keymaster's tents.""

"
"""There are one or more Huts of the Magi on this map but no Eyes of the Magi.""
The Hut of the Magi is intended to be used in conjunction with the Eye of the Magi.  When a player visits a Hut the shroud removed from the vicinities of all of the Eyes of the Magi on the map.  If there are no Eyes of the Magi on the map, visiting the Hut will be pointless.
"
"""There are one or more Eyes of the Magi on this map but no Huts of the Magi.""
The Eye of the Magi is intended to be used in conjunction with the Hut of the Magi.  When a player visits a Hut the shroud removed from the vicinities of all of the Eyes of the Magi on the map.  If there are no Huts of the Magi on the map, the Eyes will do nothing.
"
"""There are only %d available heroes on this map, but this map requires at least %d available heroes.""

"
"""All of the artifacts on this map are either disabled or reserved.""
Artifacts are reserved when they are the object of a special victory condition or the object of a quest.  Also, artifacts may be disabled on the 'Artifacts' page of the 'Map Specifications' dialog.  There must be at least one artifact which is not reserved and is not disabled.
